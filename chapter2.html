			Out of the whole cabin was a little wooden bed with no pillow, just an old red blanket that smelled like old people and full of bat poop. With no hesitation I sat down, and then lay. When your exhausted you don't care for anything.

As I get a closer look, the paintings seemed to be staring back down at me. The paintings looked really real. A couple of paintings reminded me of my grandparents who passed away not too long agao.
