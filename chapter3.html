			When I woke up the next morning, I wipe my eyes open and realized the door was wide open... I get up and grabbed the closest thing to a weapon I could which in this case was a rotten plank just chilling on the floor. I started making my way towards the door when it closes all by itself making a loud bang!

			"Who was that...?" I said scared out of my mind. I could feel all my bloods rushing to my head and my heart pounding like there was no tomorrow. All of the sudden I started to get cold and my hands got really shakey. Up to the point where I dropped the plank and sat back down on the bed.
			<br> <br>
			"You're dreaming... Just wake up!" I yelled again and again but nothing. I took a deep breath and got up then remembered about the paintings from last night.
			<br> <br>
			I decided to take a better look at those paintings. As I got closer, I realize that all those little fancy decorated squares were not plitchers frames but windows surrounding the little cabin.
