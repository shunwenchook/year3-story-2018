<h1> The cabin in the woods</h1>

<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
<p>
	As branches cracked behind me I ran faster, trying to find an exit out of these never ending grounds we call woods. I knew if I didnt find safety soon I knew I was a black bears meal. As I jump over dead trees and branches lying on the forest floor, I thought I could see an opening in the forest ahead. Getting closer, I saw a little log cabbin with boarded up windows and the door wide open calling my name.
