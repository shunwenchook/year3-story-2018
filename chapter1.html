<h1> The cabin in the woods</h1>

<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
<p>
	As branches cracked behind me I ran faster, trying to find an exit out of these never ending grounds we call woods. I knew if I didnt find safety soon I knew I was a black bears meal. As I jump over dead trees and branches lying on the forest floor, I thought I could see an opening in the forest ahead. Getting closer, I saw a little log cabbin with boarded up windows and the door wide open calling my name.
	<br>
	I ran in without hesitation and slammed the door behind me.
	<br>
	I turn around and peaked out of the little hole in the old cabin door to see if that beast was still after me. I was safe... for now anyways. I turned around slowly and started looking around this old piece of art. There was junk everywhere, torn up pillows and broken plates like if someone just junked the place and left. For some reason, it felt like I was being watched... The smell of old rotten wood and fear hit me. It started to get dark and really windy... That didn't help. I didn't want to take my chances out there in the dark so I decided to stay for the night. I mean, the owner wouldn't mind right.
